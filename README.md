# UniVRAule Bot 

![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/francescotonini/univraule-bot.svg?branch=master)

This repository contains a Telegram bot that shows rooms availability at University of Verona.

To run this Bot, simply type `yarn start` (or `yarn run dev` if you want ssh tunneling). Remember to add the following env vars:
- `API_BASE_URL`
- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`
- `TIMBER_API_KEY` and `TIMBER_SOURCE_ID`

_Please apologize for the awful documentation. This bot has been wrote quickly_
